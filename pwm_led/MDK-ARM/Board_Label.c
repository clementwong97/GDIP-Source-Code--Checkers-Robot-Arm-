/**Algorithm 2: Board Label Coordinates
 * 
 * Description: 
 * The algorithm will create a 2-D array of coordinates to map the checker board
 * So that the algorithm knows exactly the dimensions and the fesibility of the 
 * input given by the user. 
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 * Initialise arrays x, y depending on the dimension of the checker board
 * 
 *      Begin:
 *          Pull the coordinates of the current and next location
 *          Define the 2-D array of the checker board
 *          Check if the user defined move is valid 
 * 
 *      Complete Board Label Coordinates function
 * */
