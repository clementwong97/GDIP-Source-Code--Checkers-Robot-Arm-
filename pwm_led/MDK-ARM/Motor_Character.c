/**Algorithm 4: Motor Character
 * 
 * Description: 
 * The algorithm will take all the angles of movement computed in Move Decision
 * Function and assign it to all the motor function subroutines.
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 * Initialise 4 motor functions
 * 
 *      Begin:
 * 
 *          Pull all the angles of movement of each motor from the stack
 *          Send the information of the angles to all the motor functions 
 *          respectively
 *          Call the Motor Control to provide the information on the type of 
 *          motor to rotate and the angle of rotation. 
 *          
 *      Complete Motor Character Function
